# Challenge 1 - Mathematical modeling

This is a repository for for solutions and simulations about density dependence models involving two populations based on Lotka-Volterra model. Here is the description of the challenge:

Consider two species that: -at low densities are mainly mutualists -at high densities are mainly competitors

Write a model for this interaction. What do you expect to be the outcome of this interaction (competitive exclusion, coexistence, mutual exclusion, oscillations, density-dependent outcome)?

In the `R` directory you will find the scripts, in the fct file the main model function and on the docs file the rmd and html for presentation.
